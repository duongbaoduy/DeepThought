DeepThought is a one-page organizational app written in Ruby on Rails and Backbone, inspired by Workflowy. It allows users to smoothly outline all thoughts and tasks into a single uncluttered list. Projects can be broken down into sublists; each sublist can then be "zoomed" into, allowing users to focus on the task at hand. A breadcrumb in the header links to all ancestor lists for quick zoom-out.

Keyboard shortcuts allow for quick traversal and reorganization of lists. The order of bullet points is preserved by storing the parent and a rank score amongst siblings. Data is stored on the client side as well as the server side, to ensure that views update quickly upon navigation. Views are generated by recursively calling Marionette compositeView on each bullet and its children.
