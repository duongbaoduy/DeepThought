              DeepThought is a clone of WorkFlowy, created with Backbone, Marionette, and Ruby on Rails. It is a simplistic one-page app, where users organize their thoughts into a hierarchical list. Each bullet point can be zoomed into such that only its children are displayed, allowing users to focus on the task at hand.

              The view is generated by recursively calling Marionette compositeView: for each bullet, we generate a model view of a textbox, followed by a collection view of its children. Keyboard shortcuts allow for quick navigation and rearrangement of the list. The order of bullet points are preserved by storing rank amongst sibling bullet points, and storing parent/children relationships. Data is updated upon change on the client side as well as the server side, to ensure that the order is maintained upon navigation.

              DeepThought is still under development. Here are a list of features that have yet to be added
              <li>Drag and drop</li>
              <li>Completed tasks</li>

                <!-- WorkFlowy is deceptively simple. It's just an outliner – a list-maker! You click on a new line, write whatever you have to write, and hit Enter. Done – you now have a bullet, a "to-do item," or whatever you want to call it. Hit Shift+Enter, and you can add some text as a note for that item.

There is nothing revolutionary about it, except for one key difference: it lets you drill into items. By "drilling in," I mean that you can click the bullet next to an item (or press Ctrl+right arrow), and you're then transported "into" the item. You no longer see the whole list – the item you've selected becomes the "master item," and it looks like it's the top of the hierarchy.

This simple difference makes it possible to forget that you have a huge list of other items. It makes it possible to use Workflowy for managing a whole bunch of disparate projects, thoughts, and whatnot. Workflowy was intentionally kept simple -- there are no "tags." You can't send links to specific items. There are no collaboration features. It's a very single-minded tool, and it just works.
